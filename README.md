# Football-Analysis-AI

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision to build a comprehensive football analysis system. It includes object detection using YOLOv8, object tracking, team classification, and measurement of player movement, speed, and distance covered.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Object Detection:**
   - Detect players, referees, and footballs using YOLOv8 provided by Ultralytics.

2. **Custom Object Detector:**
   - Train and fine-tune your own YOLO model on custom data to improve detection accuracy.

3. **Team Assignment:**
   - Use KMeans to cluster pixel values and identify team colors based on t-shirts.

4. **Camera and Player Movement:**
   - Use optical flow for camera movement detection and perspective transformation to measure player movement in meters.

5. **Player Speed Calculation:**
   - Track players across frames and calculate speed and distance covered.
